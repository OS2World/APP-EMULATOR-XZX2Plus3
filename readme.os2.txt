This is the OS/2 port of XZX 2 Plus3.

This program can convert a ZX Spectrum emulator file (XZX or raw) into a +3 Disk file.

For more informations, consult the README file included with the original distribution.

To use this program you will need the GCC 4.5.2 DLLs, which are on netlabs or at
Paul Smedley's OS/2 software site.

I include the original sources, but of course you will need only the executable file to use
this program.

If you find this program useful, please consider making a donation to Paul Smedley, whose
hard work on OS/2 made it possible to have modern applications and port native OS/2 software.

Have fun
